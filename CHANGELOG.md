## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added a provider abstraction layer for OAuth-backed integrations, including a reusable provider registry and shared OAuth helpers.
- Added regression coverage for release metadata extraction so tagged releases read notes from the versioned changelog section.

- Changed OpenAI Codex provider internals to use the shared provider/OAuth architecture for future provider expansion.

### Changed
